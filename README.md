# MapRepair

### Installation

Implementation and a dedicated README can be found in "implementation/" directory

### Scenarios

Scenarios used for the benchmark of the corresponding paper and additional scenarios can be found in "scenarios/" directory, as well as the iBench configuration used to generate the policy views ("configIBench.txt) and the metadata about the generated mappings to repair ("metadataMappings.csv").

Each directory in "scenarios/" contain :
* a "PV.xml" file, corresponding to a policy views set from iBench converted in a format usable by our implementation.
* Other files are mappings generated from "PV.xml" source schema and needing to be repaired.
